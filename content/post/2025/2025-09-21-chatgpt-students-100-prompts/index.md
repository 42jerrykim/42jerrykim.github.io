### 바로가기
[Study](#study) · [Career](#career) · [Life](#life)

### 플레이스홀더 가이드
- [topic]: 주제(예: deep learning, epigenetics)
- [mood]: 현재 감정 상태(예: overwhelmed, unmotivated)
- [notes or slides]: 강의 노트/슬라이드
- [length]: 분량(예: 15-page)
- [APA or MLA]: 인용 스타일
- [course] / [exam format]: 과목 / 시험 형식(예: MCQ)
- [language] / [concept] / [domain] / [word]: 언어/개념/전문영역/단어
- [type of interview] / [job] / [industry or location]: 인터뷰/직무/지역
- [type of advisor] / [role] / [company] / [team]: 멘토 유형/역할/회사/팀
- [city] / [dates] / [time of year]: 여행 도시/기간/계절
- [meal] / [number of people] / [$ per person]: 식사 유형/인원/예산

### 사용 팁
- 맥락 풍부하게: 배경, 목표, 제약, 평가 기준을 함께 제공하세요.
- 형식 지정: "표로 정리", "체크리스트로", "마일스톤별"처럼 출력 형식을 명시하세요.
- 소크라테스 모드: "한 번에 한 질문씩" 진행을 요청하면 이해도 점검에 좋습니다.
- 파일 우선: 강의노트/슬라이드/과제 PDF를 첨부하면 정확도가 크게 올라갑니다.
- 반복 개선: 초안→피드백→개선의 2~3회 루프가 가장 효율적입니다.

### 주의
- 중요한 결정(학업·법률·의료)은 항상 2차 검증하세요.
- 개인정보·기밀 파일은 업로드 전에 민감정보를 제거하세요.
- 학술 인용은 원문 링크/DOI를 직접 열어 사실을 확인하세요.
